/*Implicit casting:
When type casting is happening automatically by the compiler then it is called as Implicit Casting.

Explicit Casting:
When type casting is happening explicitly by the programmer then it is called as Explicit Casting.

There are two types of conversions:
o Widening
o Narrowing

        Widening is the process of converting lower type to higher type. This is a safe conversion.
        Narrowing is the process of converting higher type to lower type.
